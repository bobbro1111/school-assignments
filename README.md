Portfolio of Academic Projects
This repository contains a selection of projects completed during my studies, showcasing my skills in Python, Java, and R. Each project demonstrates the application of various programming paradigms and algorithmic approaches to solve complex problems.

***Python Projects***

  Reinforcement Learning for Gold Finding: This project involves developing a reinforcement learning agent to navigate a grid-based environment. The agent is trained to maximize a reward function by finding gold while avoiding hazards. It serves as an example of an AI learning optimal behavior through trial and error.

  Genetic Algorithm for Class Scheduling: This project utilizes a genetic algorithm to solve the NP-hard problem of class scheduling. It efficiently generates optimal or near-optimal schedules by mimicking natural selection, demonstrating a practical application of evolutionary computation to a real-world optimization challenge.

***Java Projects***

  Disease Simulation: This simulation models the spread of a disease through a population. It features a graphical user interface (GUI) with sliders that allow users to interactively change key variables, such as transmissibility and recovery rate, and observe the resulting impact on the simulation in real time.

  Simulated News Page with Java Graphics: This project simulates a dynamic news page using Java's graphical libraries. It demonstrates proficiency in GUI design and event handling to create an interactive and visually organized display of simulated news articles.

***R Projects***

  Analysis of the Archegos Capital Meltdown: This project analyzes the collapse of Archegos Capital Management using publicly available financial data. It highlights the use of R for data cleaning, statistical analysis, and data visualization to explain complex financial events and trends.
